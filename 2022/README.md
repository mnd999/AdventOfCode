# AdventOfCode-2022

My attempts at [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/). 


I chose C++ as it's not a language I've touched for a long time and it seemed like a fun challenge to go back and use a language I'm not too familiar with. 

For Day 12, I snuck a bit of Neo4j (my day job) in. It was good to get some practice in with the algorithms in the GDS library.
